Exploration of covidgraph by Nick

# Project Description
Identify the role age and cardiovascualr disease play in evaluating COVID-19 risk factors and identify potential risk factors involved using text mining and knoweldge graph tools.

# Set-Up
Apply text mining algorithms on research paper databases to extract meaningful keyword relationships regarding COVID (age, biochemical factors, risk-factors, pre-existing conditions etc.). Use a knowledge graph platform (Neo4j) to establish relationships between relevant data points.

# Run Process (currently)
- Use provided cypher queries from BuildGraph
- Import data and research paper nodes/relationships/labels
- Visualize resulting data, oraganize data for further processing/analysis
